_Features:_
* Robust in anti-cheating measures
* **99.4% Accuracy** in detection.
* Attendance with Time is stored into the database.
* Very Accurate in Different Light Conditions especially low-light

_Algorithm_:
* Uses Dlib's Histogram of Oriented Gradients Technique for Face Detection and Orientation
* Uses FaceNet (Deep Learning Model) for Face Identification
* Uses SVM Classifier to query database rapidly (to match face)
* Eye Blink Detection for anti face-cheating

_Implementation_:
* Used Python Language
* OpenCV, dlib, face_recogntion Libraries

_This code is deployment ready upon slight few changes_
